    "So far, we have only dealt with regression problems. However, supervised learning involves two main groups of tasks - regression tasks and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While for regression problems the output of the model is a continuous value (float or integer), in classification tasks, the output of the model is a class indicator/group in which the object belongs.\n",

    "We will start with a small dataset with fish to not spend much time on data cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to predict the species of fish (Perch - *perch*, Roach - *roach*, Pike - *pike*, ...), it is a prediction of a categorical value, ie. a classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems have slightly different properties and logic than regression problems, so there are models directly designed for such problems. They are called classifiers.\n",
    "But first we will try to look at the task of classification from the perspective of data."

    "What is a classification threshold? \n",
    "Imagine that in a `breast cancer` task, the learned model will not return the values 0/1 (negative, positive finding), but a `float` number indicating the probability (or some degree) of belonging to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, you will classify samples with a probability greater than 0.5 as positive, others as negative. However, you may want to be careful and examine patients who have a worse finding, although not so bad that the model gives a response greater than 0.5. Then this threshold will not be 0.5, but eg. 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can be a supporter of the \"do not scare them\" approach, and you decide to examine only patients with a really bad finding. The threshold would be moved to 0.7, for example. What approach should be taken depends on the specific situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows the relationship between the probability of detection (**true positive rate** or sensitivity, recall) TPR and the probability of false alarm (**false positive rate**) FPR.\n",

    "\n",
    "P, N ... are the numbers of all positive / negative samples\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows the probability of a false alarm on the x-axis and the probability of detection on the y-axis. This for all classification thresholds. The higher the classification threshold, the lower the probability of a false alarm and the lower the sensitivity. The lower the classification threshold, the greater the probability of detection (sensitivity) and the greater the risk of false alarms."

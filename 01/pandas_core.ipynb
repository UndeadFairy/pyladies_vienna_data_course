    "Before any complex analysis, it is necessary to learn the basics of working with processed data. Data can be of various natures - one-dimensional, two-dimensional, structured, unstructured, visual, audio ... In the lessons of exploratory data analysis, we will work mostly with **tabular** data - such as those you certainly know from your favorite (or unpopular) tabular processor (\"spreadsheet\"). Usually every **row** of such a table corresponds to some thing, an example of something, or some observation. In the individual **columns** there are individual properties, measured quantities or characteristic for these things.\n",
    "In the Python world, the **pandas** library is most commonly used to process tabular data. It allows you to read data from many formats (including XLS(x) workbooks), edit them in various ways, calculate columns very efficiently, directly examine some statistical indicators and last but not least, nicely visualize the results. This lesson will introduce you to the basic concepts and teach you how to access individual columns, rows and cells.\n",

Conversely, the name `pandas` will no longer be defined. In normal programming, we try to avoid aliases because they reduce the readability of the code for other programmers. It's different with data analytics, because using one alias, which is also very common, saves us a lot of typing. And programmers are lazy."
